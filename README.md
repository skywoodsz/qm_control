## Overview

qm_control is a controller for quadruped manipulators using model predictive control and whole-body control. The controller aims to make the quadruped manipulator more athletic. It has achieved tasks such as *whole-body planning*, *end-effector motion tracking*, *stability with force disturbance*, and *whole-body compliance control*. We will continue to develop more features for the controller. **The project is still under development, not the final version**.

***Notes:*** Four branches focus on different tasks.

-   The main branch focuses on the whole-body motion and assumes no force acting on the manipulator's end-effector.
-   [feature-force](https://github.com/skywoodsz/qm_control/tree/feature-force) branch focuses on keeping stability with force disturbance acting on the manipulator's end-effector.
-   [feature-compliance](https://github.com/skywoodsz/qm_control/tree/feature-compliance) branch focuses on whole-body compliance control.
-   [feature-real](https://github.com/skywoodsz/qm_control/tree/feature-real) branch implements the controller on hardware.

## Usage

We have two versions of the controller:  **MPC with WBC** and **only MPC**.

### MPC-WBC

Launch the simulation with:

```
mon launch qm_gazebo empty_world.launch
```

Load the controller:

```
mon launch qm_controllers load_controller.launch
```

Start the controller using `rqt_controller_manager` GUI

```
rosrun rqt_controller_manager rqt_controller_manager
```

After the manipulator is initialized, commands can be sent

```
# Don't use mon
roslaunch qm_controllers load_qm_target.launch 
# rviz
mon launch qm_controllers rviz.launch
```

### MPC Only

Launch the simulation with:

```
mon launch qm_gazebo empty_world_mpc.launch
```

Load the controller:

```
mon launch qm_controllers load_controller_mpc.launch
```

## Gamepad Control

You can use the gamepad to control the quadruped base and the manipulator's end-effector respectively. The schematic diagram of the gamepad is as follows:

## End-effector stability testing in simulation

***Analysis***: The motion of the base and end-effector pose w.r.t. the initial pose when the end-effector is controlled to remain at a fixed pose during locomotion. While the base travels 30 cm, the end-effector’s deviation from its initial position is at most 3.5 mm and 2.6 degrees.

## Bugs & Feature Requests

The project is still in the early stages of development and we welcome feedback.  Please report bugs and request features using the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/skywoodsz/qm_control/issues) or Email skywoodszcn@gmail.com

## TODO

- [ ] Solve the singularity problem.
- [ ] Add the foot trajectory planning.
- [ ] Merge the branch feature-real to the main.
